      <h3>What's the best gift God could give you?</h3>
      <p>We all want to be happy. Why is lasting happiness so hard to find?</p>
      <p>Life Explored is for anyone who wants to find contentment and happiness in life.  It's an informal and relaxed seven-week course.  It's run by ordinary local Christian people and it's completely free.  You don't need to know anything about the Bible, and you won't be asked to pray or sing!  You can ask any questions you like, or you can just sit and listen.</p>
      <p>Whoever you are, whatever you're thinking, Life Explored is a place for you to discover the greatest gift in the universe.</p>

      <h3>Discoverers</h3>        
      <p>Discoverers is a fun lunchtime club for KS1 children (Y1 & Y2) held at Oughtibridge School. It is an opportunity for children to explore the bible in a child friendly environment.</p>
      <p>Due to high numbers we run two groups, alternating each half term. The club runs Autumn and Winter terms but not in the Summer term, to allow the children to enjoy playing outside. Please Contact Us if you would like more information.</p>
